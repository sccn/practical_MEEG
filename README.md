# Introduction

This repository is for the EEGLAB sessions of the [practical MEEG 2022 workshop](https://practicalmeeg2022.org/). There are 5 sessions:
* Preprocessing
* Single sensor analysis (ERP/ERF)
* Single and distributed sources
* Time-frequency domain
* Group-level analysis

For each session, we have prepared a script detailed below.

We will use data from the multimodal face recognition dat. BIDS dataset containing a pruned version of the OpenNeuro dataset ds000117. It is available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7410278).

The dataset above only contains one subject. For group level analysis, please use the following BIDS repository [here](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002718/versions/1.0.5).
